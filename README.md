# No-correlation-between-somatic-clonal-expansion-and-cancer-risk-across-human-organs

The code clean-up and documentation is still a work in progress. The code may undergo significant changes before the paper is accepted or published.

## Prepare Environment
To improve reproducibility and ease of use, this project uses conda/mamba for environment management. mamba is recommended for the speed.

You can set up an environment to run the code with:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Janzulene/No-correlation-between-somatic-clonal-expansion-and-cancer-risk-across-human-organs.git
cd No-correlation-between-somatic-clonal-expansion-and-cancer-risk-across-human-organs/
mamba env update --file environment.yaml
```

## Prepare Data
All the data used in this paper can be downloaded from the web. Because of space constraints, this repository does not contain any raw data, but it does provide some functions for downloading and obtaining the corresponding data.
